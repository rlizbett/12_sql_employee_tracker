 ## Description 
     The purpose of this assignment was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems.(*working on demo video and screenshots*)
